Description: Some functions of 'ade4' and 'stats' are combined in order to obtain a partition of the rows of a data table, with columns representing variables of scales: quantitative, qualitative or frequency. 
  First, a principal axes method is performed and then, a combination of Ward agglomerative hierarchical classification and K-means is performed, using some of the first coordinates obtained from the previous principal axes method. See, for example: 
      Lebart, L. and Piron, M. and Morineau, A.  (2006).
      Statistique Exploratoire Multidimensionnelle, Dunod, Paris.
  In order to permit to have different weights of the elements to be clustered, the function 'kmeansW', programmed in C++, is included. It is a modification of 'kmeans'.   
  Some graphical functions include the option: 'gg=FALSE'.  When 'gg=TRUE', they  use the 'ggplot2' and 'ggrepel' packages to avoid  the super-position of the labels.
